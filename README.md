## Operator that puts a pod's nodeName in the pod labels

I needed this and couldn't find it, so I made it. Most of the files here were generated by the operator-sdk program. The meat of the operator is in `controllers/pod_controller.go`.

Basically, if you annotate a pod with the annotation `k8s.maxweiss.io/label-pod-node: "true"` then the pod will magically get a label called "nodeName" which matches the pod's spec.nodeName.

To build the docker image yourself, just run `make docker-build`.

To generate the Kubernetes resources in order to install this, go to the config/default directory and run `kustomize build`. Once you apply the output to your cluster, you're good to go.
